# Solubility_model_development
Building regression model based on the CRISP-DM methodology. Comparing different regression algorithms and choosing the best one.

Selected algorithms (from scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras):
- linear
- Lasso
- Ridge
- elastic nets
- decision tree
- random forest 
- gradient boost
- SVR
- MLP
- DNN

I used hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross validation.
